# Massdriver Landing Page

Here is a NextJS Landing Page made to replicate/improve massdriver.cloud. 

## Live Demo
You can view my live website at [Merciful's Massdriver Landing Page](https://merciful-massdriver.netlify.app/).

## Overview
This website is built with latest versions of NextJS and Tailwindcss providing an optimized, fast, and responsive UX.

## Tools & Technologies Used
- **Next.js 15.2.0**: A powerful React framework for building static and dynamic websites. It's used for routing, static page generation, and optimization.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework used for fast UI design.
- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Framer Motion**: A library for animations in React, providing smooth transitions.
- **Lucide React**: For clean, customizable icons.
- **TypeScript**: A superset of JavaScript that adds static types, providing improved development experience and code safety.
- **ESLint**: For linting JavaScript code to ensure consistent style and avoid errors.
- **Radix UI**: A set of low-level UI primitives to build accessible, customizable design systems.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
